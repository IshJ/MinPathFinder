# MinPathFinder
Minimum path finder using Viterbi Algorithm

Implemented based on the scenario based on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JVqutwtzmo. 

weights are the distance metrices between layers. 

Sample run command would look like; python MinPathFinder.py --weights_file weights.txt --output_file output.txt

Only Numpy has been used as an external library. 

Comments and questions are mostly welcome!
